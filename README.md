### What is ATC ( APIs test client)
It is a rust CLI tool to help testing Restful API endpoints

### How it should work
- The tool is segmented into namespaces
- Each namespace represents a collection of API endpoints & is configurable
- The tool will read JSON Schema and generate the configuration file within the namespace
- QC Team can use the tool to test different collections on the go
- QC Team can modify the generated configuration files
